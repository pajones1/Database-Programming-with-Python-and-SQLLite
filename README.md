# Working with Geospatial Data üåç

## Overview
This tutorial explores how to work with **geospatial data** using Python. It covers **retrieving, processing, and visualizing location-based data** from various sources. By the end, you'll understand how to interact with APIs, manipulate geospatial data, and gain insights through visualization.

## Key Topics Covered
- Querying location-based APIs
- Extracting and handling geospatial data
- Processing responses in JSON format
- Visualizing geospatial data using Python

## Technologies Used
- **Python 3**
- **Requests**: Fetching data from APIs
- **JSON**: Parsing and handling API responses
- **Pandas**: Managing and analyzing data
- **Matplotlib**: Visualizing geospatial insights

## Installation & Setup
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have **Python 3** installed along with the required libraries:
```bash
pip install requests pandas matplotlib
